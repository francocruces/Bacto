To add a custom map you must follow this syntax:

 - First line must contain map's name (NAME)
    e.g. NAME="Ellipse"

 - The rest of the lines can be in any order, but there MUST be:

    - Number of enemies (N_ENEMIES)
        e.g. N_ENEMIES=1

    - At least one player colony (PLAYER_COL)

    - At least one enemy colony (ENEMY_COL)

 - Now you can add as many empty colonies as you want (EMPTY_COLONY)

Every colony follows the same syntax:
    X_COL=[player_number],[horizontal_position],[vertical_position],[radius]


Please DO NOT add any unnecessary spaces or empty lines
